	<br />In 2013, world production of chicken eggs was 68.3 million tonnes. The largest four producers were China at 24.8 million of this total, the United States at 5.6 million, India at 3.8 million, and Japan at 2.5 million. A typical large egg plant ships a million dozen eggs a week. 
	<br />During production eggs usually are candled to check their quality. The size of its air cell is determined and the examination also reveals whether the egg was fertilized and thereby contains an embryo. Depending on local regulations they may be washed before being placed in egg boxes. Washing may shorten their length of freshness.

<h2 id="hello">HELLO</h2>

<p>Eggs contain multiple proteins that gel at different temperatures within the yolk and the white, and the temperature determines the gelling time. Egg yolk becomes a gel, or solidifies, between 65 and 70 °C (149 and 158 °F). Egg white gels at different temperatures: 60 to 73 °C (140 to 163 °F). The white contains exterior albumen which sets at the highest temperature. In <a href="link">practice</a>, in many cooking processes the white gels first because it is exposed to higher temperatures for longer.</p>

<p>Salmonella is killed instantly at 71 °C (160 °F), but also is killed from 54.5 °C (130.1 °F), if held at that temperature for sufficiently long time periods. To avoid the issue of salmonella, eggs may be pasteurized in-shell at 57 °C (135 °F) for an hour and 15 minutes. Although the white then is slightly milkier, the eggs may be used in normal ways. Whipping for meringue takes significantly longer, but the final volume is virtually the same.</p>

<p>If a boiled egg is overcooked, a greenish ring sometimes appears around egg yolk due to changes to the iron and sulfur compounds in the egg. It also may occur with an abundance of iron in the cooking water. <mark>Overcooking</mark> harms the quality of the protein. Chilling an overcooked egg for a few minutes in cold water until it is completely cooled may prevent the greenish ring from forming on the surface of the yolk.</p>

<p>Peeling a cooked egg is easiest when the egg was put into boiling water as opposed to slowly heating the egg from a start in cold water.</p>

<p>Although the age of the egg and the conditions of its storage have a greater influence, the bird’s diet affects the flavor of the egg. For example, when a brown-egg chicken breed eats rapeseed (canola) or soy meals, its intestinal microbes metabolize them into fishy-smelling triethylamine, which ends up in the egg. The unpredictable diet of free-range hens will produce likewise, unpredictable egg flavors. Duck eggs tend to have a flavor distinct from, but still resembling, chicken eggs.</p>

<p>Eggs may be soaked in mixtures to absorb flavor. Tea eggs, a common snack sold from street-side carts in china, are steeped in a brew from a mixture of various spices, soy sauce, and black tea leaves to give flavor.</p>

<h3 id="shell">Shell</h3>
<p>Main article: <a href="link">Eggshell</a></p>

<p>Eggshell color is caused by pigment deposition during egg formation in the oviduct and may vary according to species and breed, from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green. Generally, chicken breeds with white ear lobes lay white eggs, whereas chickens with red ear lobes lay brown eggs. Although there is no significant link between shell color and nutritional value, often there is a cultural preference for one color over another (see ‘Color of eggshell’, below). Brown eggs have significantly higher incidence of blood spots due to candling being less effective.</p>

<h2 id="membrane">Membrane</h2>
<p>Main article: <a href="">Natural eggshell membrane</a></p>

<p>The eggshell membrane is a clear film lining the eggshell, visible when one peels a boiled egg. Primarily, it composed of fibrous proteins such as collagen type I. These membranes may be used commercially as a dietary supplement.</p>

<h2 id="white">White</h2>
<p>Main article: <a href="">Egg white</a></p>

<p><img src="https://www.seriouseats.com/images/2014/10/20141021-egg-whites-yolk-test-daniel-gritzer-8.jpg" class="custom float-right" /></p>

<p>“White” is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. Clear initially, upon cooking it turns white. In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around both fertilized and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the embryo.</p>

<p>Egg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the carbohydrate content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of vaccines, such as those for influenza.</p>

<h2 id="yolk">Yolk</h2>
<p>Main article: <a href="">Egg yolk</a></p>

<p>The yolk in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the vitelline membrane (the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape.</p>

<p>Yolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant pigments known as xanthophylls, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. Lutein is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk. A diet without such colorful foods may result in an almost colorless yolk. Yolk color is, for example, enhanced if the diet includes foods such as yellow corn and marigold petals. In the US, the use of artificial color additives is forbidden.</p>
