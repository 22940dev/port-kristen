				<h1 id="hi-my-name-is-kristen-kwong">Hi! My name is Kristen Kwong.</h1>

<p>I’m a software engineer currently located in beautiful <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vancouver,+BC">Vancouver, Canada</a>. I’ve been studying Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> since 2015. I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in May 2020 with 12 months of work experience.</p>

<p>I’ve had an interest in working with computers since learning to write Tumblr themes with HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript and designing graphics with Photoshop and Illustrator in the 7th grade. Playing video games also sparked my interest in programming.</p>

<p>Previously, I’ve interned at <a href="/experiences/apple_2018S.html">Apple</a> as a Software Engineering Intern and <a href="/experiences/netgear_2017W.html">Netgear</a> as a Software Test Engineer. I have experience in a variety of areas, including <mark>automation</mark> and <mark>full-stack web development</mark>. I am currently developing my knowledge in the areas of computer hardware, operating systems, and networking.</p>

<p>One of the most rewarding experiences of university was co-founding <a href="/experiences/lhd_2016W.html">UBC Hacks</a> in 2016, where I organized two annual Local Hack Days, focussing on making the tech community more inclusive, accessible, and diverse. I was also in charge of branding, marketing, and design. In 2018, we joined with <a href="https://www.nwhacks.io/">nwPlus</a> to make <a href="https://www.nwplus.io/#/localhackday">UBC Local Hack Day 2018</a> bigger and better, where I became the Co-Director of LHD.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about <mark>tech education</mark>; I believe that learning about how the world is impacted by technological advancements is beneficial to people of all backgrounds and fields. I really enjoyed working as a <a href="/experiences/ta_2019W.html">Teaching Assistant</a> for the introductory Computer Science course at UBC. I’ve also volunteered for <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/girlsmarts4tech/">GirlSmarts4Tech</a> and <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/">Canada Learning Code</a>.</p>

<p>I love what I do, and I’m privileged to have the opportunity to work with and learn from some really amazing people in academia and industry. I’m always looking for opportunities to further develop my skills, and positively impact those around me with meaningful work.</p>

<p>You can find me online on <a href="https://twitter.com/kristenkwng">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristenkwong/">LinkedIn</a>, or through <a href="mailto:kristenkwong@gmail.com">email</a>. When I’m not coding, I’m probably travelling, listening to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/spider-man-into-spider-verse-soundtrack-from-inspired/1445949265">music</a>, eating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristenvsfood/">brunch</a>, drawing, and/or playing video games (not necessarily but <em>possibly</em> at the same time).</p>
